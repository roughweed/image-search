# image-search
This app finds out visually similar images from a specific directory

# Kudos
This app has been created using the resources from https://github.com/creotiv/computer_vision/tree/master/opencv_image_search
The original app has been created using Python2. I changed some modules, added arg feature and converted it to Python3.

# How to use
Download the main.py file<br>
Search images using command line
<b>python&nbsp;main.py&nbsp;<i>path/name_of_image.jpg</i>&nbsp;<i>path_of_search_directory</i></b><br>
<b>For example</b> python&nbsp;main.py&nbsp;images/this_dog.jpg&nbsp;all_images
